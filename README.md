# EM-25 Front End

Two Kontakt 6 instruments that use the [Elektronika EM-25 sample library](https://github.com/publicsamples/Elektronika-EM-25).

**EM-25 Front End LE**

A single "oscillator" synthesizer with drawbar controls for each of the EM-25 sound groups, multi mode filter, 3 AHRSR envelopes 2 LFOs & delay. NOTHING FANCY :)

**EM-25 Front End XL**

A dual "oscillator" version with a twist. Each drawbar in oscillator 1 can be tuned and modulated individually, essentially giving us control over 11 oscillators and 12 LFO's.  As you'd expect this is great for massive pads, drones and orchestral effects.
